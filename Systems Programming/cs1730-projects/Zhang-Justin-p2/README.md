To compile:
    make
To run:
    ./fifteen (board size)

1. This program allows for any game board between 3x3 and 9x9 inclusive
2. An array of arrays, or a 2D array, of integers are used to represent
   the points of the board.
3. The greet() function is used to greet the player.
4. I needed to implement the init(), draw(), move(int), and won() functions, and
   I implemented the isInBounds(int) and tileLocation(int) as helper functions.
